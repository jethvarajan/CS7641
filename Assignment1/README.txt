=======================================

********* Prerequisites / Software installation ********* 
1) Download Anaconda navigator (Python3.7) from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
2) Here is the download link specific to Mac OS https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
3) Verify you have python3.7 installed. Run "python3 --version" command on Mac, Unix,Linux Terminal or Windows command prompt. It should print "Python 3.7.1" output. If python 3.7 is not installed, install it using https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/


********* Download Code from Canvas ********* 
1) Clone GitHub repository from "https://github.com/jethvarajan/CS7641" using "git clone https://github.com/jethvarajan/CS7641.git" command
2) Navigate to CS7641/Assignment1 Directory. It should have below list of files
	* "Cuisine.ipynb" - Contains code specific to Cuisine dataset
	* "pendigits.ipynb" - Contains code specific to pen digits dataset
	* "train.json" - Contains dataset for Cuisines and ingredients
	* "pendigits.csv" - Contains dataset for scanned normalized value for digits
	* "requirements.txt" - Lists the required python libraries
	
********* Run Code ********* 
1) Via Terminal/Command line go to folder where you unzipped zip file
2) Run this command "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will install all the required python libraries for this assignment.
3) Open Cuisine.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook Lab from Anaconda Navigator
4) Run each code block in sequence from notebook
5) Open pendigits.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook Lab from Anaconda Navigator
6) Run each code block in sequence from notebook
7) In case if you get error to load data, Make sure you have placed train.json and pendigits.csv file in the same folder as your *.ipynb files.
